"It's a Matter of Respect: A Model of Workplace Civility","In contrast to workplace incivility, workplace civility has been largely ignored by management researchers. Drawing on literature from other disciplines, we define workplace civility as entailing respect for two universal human rights: the right to human dignity and the right to privacy. Also, we articulate a model of workplace civility.","Poster",5240,22,2009
"Testing the Dimensionality of Organizational Citizenship Behaviors and Contextual Performance","Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) consists of five types of behaviors. OCB has been equated with Contextual Performance, which also consists of five types of behaviors. In this study, different dimensional models of these constructs were tested. Separate dimensions were distinguishable in self- and peer ratings, but not in supervisor ratings.","Poster",5241,22,2009
"Person-Environment Fit, Organizational Commitment, and Job Performance Behaviors","This study proposed that the relationships between employee's perceived fits and job performance behaviors (organizational citizenship behavior [OCB] and task performance) would be mediated and also moderated by organizational commitment. We examined three types of fits, including person-organization, person-supervisor, and person-coworkers. The findings supported most of our hypotheses.","Poster",5242,22,2009
"Who Benefits from Organizational Citizenship Behavior?","Significant differences were found in ratings of how co-workers, supervisors, the company, customers and the benefactor him/herself benefited from Organizational Citizenship Behaviors. Although particular OCBs benefited recipients differently, most still were rated as beneficial to the organization; therefore, they are appropriate means for expressing reciprocity with a benevolent organization","Poster",5243,22,2009
